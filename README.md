Codecademy Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

This is a final project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path, Unit 2/5 (Improved Styling with CSS). The index.html and style.css code was built by me. 

The purpose of this project is to build a style guide/design system for a website. Skills practiced include colors, typography, links, styling navigation elements like links and buttons, and applying more custom colors.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
